Libraries Used in Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project
1. Pandas
Description: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which are essential for handling structured data efficiently.

Use in the Project: Pandas is used extensively for loading the dataset, cleaning and preprocessing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and organizing data for modeling. It helps in tasks such as filtering, grouping, and transforming data.

2. NumPy
Description: NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

Use in the Project: NumPy is used for numerical computations and mathematical operations required during data preprocessing and model training. It is particularly useful for tasks such as scaling data, handling missing values, and performing matrix operations.

3. Matplotlib
Description: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It provides a MATLAB-like interface for generating plots and charts.

Use in the Project: Matplotlib is used to create various types of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, box plots, and more. These visualizations help in understanding the data distribution, relationships between variables, and model evaluation.

4. Seaborn
Description: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations and offers additional features like automatic data aggregation and color palettes.

Use in the Project: Seaborn is used for creating advanced statistical visualizations, such as pair plots, distribution plots, and heatmaps. It enhances the aesthetics of plots and provides valuable insights into the data distribution and relationships.

5. Scikit-learn
Description: Scikit-learn is a versatile library for machine learning in Python. It offers a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. It also provides tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and model selection.

Use in the Project: Scikit-learn is used for building and training machine learning models, particularly linear regression for predicting bike sharing demand. It also handles tasks like feature scaling, feature selection, and model evaluation using metrics such as R-squared score.

6. Statsmodels
Description: Statsmodels is a Python library for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing. It provides classes and functions for estimating and analyzing various statistical models, including linear regression, generalized linear models, time series analysis, and more.

Use in the Project: Statsmodels is used for advanced statistical analysis, particularly Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and variance inflation factor (VIF) calculation. OLS regression helps in understanding the relationship between predictor variables and the target variable, while VIF detects multicollinearity among predictor variables.

These libraries together provide a comprehensive toolkit for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization in the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project. They enable efficient handling of data, exploration of relationships, and development of predictive models to forecast bike sharing demand accurately.
